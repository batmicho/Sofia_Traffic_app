# Sofia_Traffic_app

Simple python 2.7 app using Flask.

Idea is to get the Sofia Traffic bus arrival times and bus stop IDs from their API. 

Store IDs of bus stops as favorites using sqlite database. 

Check the arrival time of the buses at the bus stop ID using less bandwidth than the original site.
